# Workshop: Creating a Keyboard Oriented Puzzle Game for Flutter

Flutter's support for Desktop and Web will bring an extra power for you to run your applications over any platform that you can imagine.

But do not forget, with great power, comes great responsibility.

As you develop your applications, you are expected to support the common use-cases of Desktop and Web platforms that you are part of. One of the biggest use-case is _Keyboard Shortcuts_.

In this workshop, you will be learning to implement the following concepts for _Keyboard Shortcuts_:

- Creating keyboard shortcuts for different purposes
- Using key combinations for your shortcuts
- Managing focus system with device keyboard

To explore these topics, you will create a word puzzle that you can control with your keyboard. You will be given five letters and expected to find a 5 letter word that is defined in a given list.

A starter project is already prepared for you. All expected functionality works with the mouse. Play around with it and get used to it. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to implement all the functionality and even more with keyboard shortcuts.

> DISCLAIMER: For the focus system and keyboard shortcuts to be working properly, it is advised to use a Flutter application on your own device. You can still continue this workshop with Dartpad, but please be sure to click at the app area at least once to initiate the first focus and also acknowledge that there might be some [issues](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/issues/2217).

If you are ready, let's go!
