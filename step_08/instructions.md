# Congratulations!

You created a whole new keyboard navigation system for your application and gave your users a chance to play your game with keyboard shortcuts.

As next step here are some suggestiong that you can do on your own to practice further:

- Add a textfield check with submission
- Reset the game at any point with ESC key
- Check out `MaterialApp` and use the `shortcuts` and `actions` that it brings
- Check out `SingleActivator`, `ShortcutActivator` classes
- Bring your application to keyboard and desktop reality!

Good luck and enjoy your game!
